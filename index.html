                    This is a time-based quiz all about the relics from the deckbuilder roguelike Slay The 
                    Spire. You have 60 seconds to identify as many relics as possible based on images, lore and
                    descriptions, with each correct answer adding a few seconds onto the clock. There are close
                    to 200 relics in the game, so this is no simple task! Go out there and prove your worth as
                    an ascender!

                    relics seen in the quiz are sourced from ethical loop mode relic hoarding.)
